## Kafka

Over 70% of fortune 500 companies now use Kafka.
Kafka is a data store, it became so popular because it isn't like other data stores such as databases, folders on network drives or cloud storage. It's often described as the central nervous system of your data.

Most of the time we think of data arriving, an API streaming data to your Kafka cluster, then we stream that into a database.
Actually this is what happens, but it is just the beginning. A bank might have 50 data feeds running into Kafka for just one application, and they could have hundreds of applications and that is just the raw data, then each team will want a different view or cut of the 
data for their own use, then they'd put that data into another Kafka topic. Kafka and message queues are everywhere in modern infrastructure, so we need to know our way around
the basics.

In this module we are going to learn the basics and use one of the most popular technologies around.
