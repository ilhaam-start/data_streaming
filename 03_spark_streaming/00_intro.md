## Streaming

In this section we'll be using Spark Streaming with Kafka. I'd say that is 
the most popular combination at the moment. kafka doesn't really have
many competitors although in the age of the cloud computing some 
proprietary solutions are popping up such as Google Pub/Sub and Amazon Kinesis,
the other open source solution Apache Pulsar. Feel free to look into them,
the concepts are mostly interchangeable between them.
Again Spark doesn't have a lot of competition either although I've seen some
teams using Apache Beam or Flink, unlike Kafka and it's competition Spark, 
Beam and Flink are very different stream solutions. We'll focus on Spark
which is still the most popular.

In this module we'll cover the basics of Spark streaming, also practice
a bit of Python and make things and do challenge from the start.
I'll try to leave you to your own devices to explore and Google
solutions where needed, but your coach will always be around if you
get stuck for too long.
